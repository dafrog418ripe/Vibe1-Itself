## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dafrog418ripe/Vibe1-Itself.git
   cd Vibe1-Itself
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python task_manager_qt.py
   ```

## Usage

### Adding Tasks
1. Type your task in the "Task" field
2. Select a priority (Low, Medium, High) - defaults to Medium
3. Click "Add Task" or press Enter

### Managing Tasks

## Project Structure

```
task-manager/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task_manager_qt.py    # Main PyQt5 application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task_manager.py       # Original Tkinter version (backup)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt      # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.json           # Task data (created automatically)
```

## Development

### Dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Import PyQt5 could not be resolved"**
- Make sure you've installed the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- On some systems, you might need: `pip install PyQt5-tools`

**App doesn't start**
- Ensure you're using Python 3.6+
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Try running: `python -c "import PyQt5; print('PyQt5 installed successfully')"`

**Tasks not saving**
- Check file permissions in the application directory
- Ensure the `tasks.json` file is not read-only
